### 作業說明: 
In this exercise, you will construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image recognition
by using Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset (TSRD.zip). 
This dataset consists of 1770 traffic sign images from 7 categories. 
Each image is a zoomed view of a single traffic sign. 
Annotations provide image properties as well as traffic sign coordinates within image and category.

The files train.csv and test.csv contain the corresponding images and their filename, width,
height, bounding box and category.
